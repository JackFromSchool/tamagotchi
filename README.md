# Tamagotchi

This is the source for my Tamagotchi project. It is based around the STM32L0x0K8
microcontroller, and uses an SSD1306 display for visuals. All code is written by
me, including any hardware drivers. If anything was taken from somewhere else,
that credit can be found in the code that was used from somewhere else.

## Purpose

There isn't any real reason for making this project, besides my own personal
enrichment. There does exist [open source tamagotchi projects](https://github.com/cifertech/TamaFi),
but I've chosen to avoid looking into any of those projects. I'm doing this so
that I can get some experience designing an embedded system from scratch. That
means that I've researched each part that was used in this project, and I've
designed all of the software and hardware systems that make it tick.

If you are out there trying to make your own embedded project, take note that
this is my first time doing this kind of thing on my own. Some choices may not
be the best for my specific situation, but I did what I knew how to do. Just
take things with a grain of salt if you go looking around the code. That being
said feel free to use any of the code written here within your own project if it
does help out. Just be sure to credit me!
